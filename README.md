# HackThe6ix Event Platform
## Description
This is a submission to [Hack the 6ix 2022](https://hackthe6ix2022.devpost.com/). We set out to build an Event Platform that accomplishes great things.

## How to use the app
Since we cannot afford to pay our tech overlords for signing/publishing certificates, you can use our application by:
1. Installing the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
2. On Android, there is a “Scan QR Code” button. On iOS, use your System Camera. Scan the QR code below.
    - Alternatively, you can follow the instructions on https://expo.dev/@h6team/hackthe6ix
  <div align="center">
    <img style='width: 30%' src="images/expo-go.svg" alt="QR Code"></img>
  </div>
<!--
2. Sign in to the Expo app with the following credentials.
    ```
    Username: 
    Password: 
    ``` 
   This step is normally only required on iOS devices. However, we recommend also doing this on Android to avoid potential access errors.

## App Development Requirements
### Required Software & Hardware
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.17.0
2. Either a physical mobile device with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app or an emulated instance of iOS (11+) or Android (5.0+).

2. Run "npm install --global expo-cli".
